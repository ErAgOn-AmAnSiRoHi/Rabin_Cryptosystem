# Rabin_Cryptosystem

**Rabin Cryptosystem** is a *public-key* encryption method named after its inventor ***Michael O. Rabin***. ​

It is characterized by its dependence on the difficulty of factoring large complex numbers into their prime factors. Unlike many other encryption schemes, Rabin encryption allows for multiple possible decryption outcomes, adding a layer of complexity to its security. ​

The decryption process requires finding the square root modulo a composite number, which makes it computationally challenging. Although theoretically secure, practical implementations often require additional techniques to address the issue of multiple decryption possibilities.​
